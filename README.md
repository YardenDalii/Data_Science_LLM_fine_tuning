# School project: working with LLM's and comparing results.
Fine Tuning on different llm models to evaluate accuracy and chance of using them to proof data basedon fine-tuning them on relevant data.

We have written a data mining algorithm to fetch data from wikipedia, preprocessing the text and use it to train the models.
